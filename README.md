# This-Website-is-Awesome
TOP whole webpage design project

## My unique attributes
I chose to use this website layout for an old pet project of mine. This website was based on what could have been a woodworking side-hustle I considered back in the day. The pictures are all stock images (credits later) but the idea and the name came from my obsession with Star Trek: TNG. The idea here is that a 2nd business, a passion project, is the closest thing we'll have to living our own second lives as Picard lived as Kamin.

## Structure
I believe that I've taken the most logical structure that I can. There are essentially 6 sections, 4 plus footer and header. Each section gets a container to fill out the space on the page and then another container that is used to position and size the content. From there, it's just container on container on container. I chose to indent my CSS because, outside of meaning nothing, it follows the HTML flow and makes construction and edits easier. I could remove them for publishing but I see no reason at the moment. Someday I will learn why this is not standard convention but that day is not today.

I chose to make the page semi-responsive. Essentially it will operate to keep content roughly centered and pleasant for a range of displays but will be distorted on very narrow viewports. I have done no mobile design or testing, so I'm not currently worried about that or people who divide their monitors 4 ways horizonally. The page will look appropriate on viewports ranging from ultrawide monitors viewed fullscreen to standard monitors windowed in half or so. Beyond that, users will be pretty aware that the page was not designed for such narrow viewports.

## In the future
If I were to rewrite this page I would start with more HTML before starting CSS, and I would be aware that a <div> in a <div> format is a minimum container arrangement for each of the 4/6 segments of the page. This layout took longer to arrive at than I'd like to admit, but it's a great arrangement. The outer <div> structures the region of the page while the inner <div> gives size and positioning to the content. Those two regions have very different design purposes and separating them gives the page a clean structure.

Another tip I'd like to forward to future me is the idea of naming the colors in plain english names until the final revision. Essentially there were 4 colors on this page per the project definition, but they were all hex-code colors. Likely, any finished project will use hex or rgb colors instead of standard HTML colors in order to not look like web 1.0. However, the human side of entering those codes is tougher. I could have written this entire CSS file using the colors 'white', 'blue', 'lightgray', and 'darkgray' or similar. That would have made building out sections, coloring buttons and text and borders much easier. At the end, a quick find-and-replace from 'white' to '#f9faf8' and so on would change the color pallette of the website rapidly.

Overall, this format does not fit the content that I've built, however it's a competant and modern format that could be used elsewhere.
